The Holy See said meeting just before a U.S. election would be inappropriate.\nBy Jason Horowitz and Lara Jakes\nSept. 30, 2020, 7:26 p.m. ET\n\nROME — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently published a sharp letter excoriating the Vatican’s plans to renew an agreement with the Chinese government on Church operations in China. He promoted the article in a tweet, concluding, “The Vatican endangers its moral authority, should it renew the deal.”\n\nAn indignant Vatican took the article more as a calculated affront than a diplomatic gesture. The friction broke into the open on Wednesday as Mr. Pompeo arrived in Rome and met with prelates and others who are hostile to Pope Francis, while the Vatican denied him a meeting with the pontiff and rebuffed his efforts to derail the deal with China.\n\n“Pompeo asked to meet” the pope, who turned him down because Francis had “clearly said that he does not receive political figures ahead of the elections,” Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who, as secretary of state, is the Vatican’s second-ranking official, told reporters.\n\nBut to some observers on both sides of the tensions between the Roman Catholic Church and the Trump administration, Mr. Pompeo’s visit is as much about the coming presidential election as about China policy. Mr. Pompeo dismissed that suggestion as absurd, but intended or not, his trip signals that President Trump is on the side of those conservative American Catholics who worry about the church’s direction under Francis and think he is soft on China.\n\nFrancis and Mr. Trump, who have exchanged sharp words in the past, present starkly different visions on issues ranging from the environment to immigration to the threat of populism. In appealing to the Vatican’s support for religious freedom as a reason to drop its China agreement, Mr. Pompeo seemed to seek common ground, but in a way that upset the pope’s chief allies and delighted his chief critics.\n\nCardinal Parolin said Mr. Pompeo’s article had caused “surprise” at the Vatican, because this visit to Rome by the secretary and the meetings with high officials at the Holy See had already been in the works and would have been a “more opportune” forum for airing grievances. He added that Mr. Pompeo’s choice to publish in First Things, a conservative Christian magazine that has called Francis a failure as Pope, also mattered.\nhttps:<em>//</em>www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/world/europe/pompeo-pope-francis-china.html\n","threadId":10864179,"timestamp":1601523803,"trip":null,"userId":"39774c","media":[{"filename":"09302020nyt1.png","url":"https://qalerts.app/media/08e41859ca2515db376999299074104a284701075e774fa4c4ab36b1ebe9d5d8.png"}]}]},{"email":null,"id":10864364,"link":"https://8kun.net/qresearch/res/10864179.html#10864364","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"&gt;&gt;10864340\nInformation

nullify, or challenge political control of a region.’\nInsurgents seek to subvert or displace the government and completely or partially control the resources and population of a given territory. They do so through the use of force (including guerrilla warfare, terrorism and coercion/intimidation), propa- ganda, subversion and political mobilization. Insurgents fight government forces only to the extent needed to achieve their political aims: their main effort is not to kill counterinsurgents, but rather to establish a competitive system of control over the population, making it impossible for the government to administer its territory and people. Insurgent activity is therefore designed to weaken government control and legitimacy while increasing insurgent control and influence.\nInsurgents require supporters, recruits, safe havens, money, supplies, weapons and intelligence on government actions. A robust insurgency can be waged with the support of just a small percentage of a given population.\nNEXT:\nCounterinsurgency may be defined as ‘comprehensive civilian and military efforts taken to simultaneously defeat and contain insurgency and address its root causes’.\nQ\n","threadId":"10644330","timestamp":1600101271,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"a54ff9"},{"email":null,"id":"10644371","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/10644330.html#10644371","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"What happens when people in positions of power are sympathizers to the cause or part of that same ‘organization’ themselves?\nWhat is a ‘safe zone’?\nWhy are riots conducted in specific [D] controlled locations?\nWhat happens when elected officials [governors/mayors] handcuff the officers instead of criminals?\nWhat happens when elected officials [governors/mayors] refuse to call in the national guard or other federal assistance?\nSacrificing the lives and well-being of the community for a calculated political gain [or other]?\nhttps:<em>//</em>www.kgw.com/article/news/crime/man-arrested-for-starting-at-least-7-brush-fires-along-i-205/283-a659a1ed-db3b-4f03-9583-a9fee05a5033\nDoes ANTIFA fear prosecution?\nWould they continue to operate if they did?\nWhat organized group(s) are bailing out rioters within 24-hours of arrest?\nWhat happens post bailout? \nDo charges remain enforced or dropped by DA?\nhttps:<em>//</em>ktvz.com/news/oregon-northwest/2020/08/11/portland-da-announces-new-policy-wont-prosecute-protest-charges/\nDA: will not act re: “low-level’ arrests\nHave all refusal to bring charges been related to “low-level” arrests?\nhttps:<em>//</em>twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1294487845810233345\nSympathizer? \nOther?\nWhat happens when prosecutors, board of county commissioner members, volunteer firefighters, etc. are sympathetic to the cause? \nWhat happens if the organization [ANTIFA] itself is aware?\nInfiltration not invasion. \nQ\n","threadId":"10644330","timestamp":1600100632,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"a54ff9"},{"email":null,"id":"10636383","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/10635766.html#10636383","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"https:<em>//</em>twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1305257519531659265\nQ\n","threadId":"10635766","timestamp":1600038257,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"f64c4e"},{"email":null,"id":"10635981","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/10635766.html#10635981","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Jedidiah Fulton, 39 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/GWLYq]\nAlberto Vincent Acosta [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/cFPbd]\nKevin Carle, 37 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/xHiFO]\nIvan Geronimo Gomez, 30 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/mhKtG]\nGuadalupe Molina-Pacheco [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/US23e]\nJulian Draper [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/JyfJe]\nDemarco Covey, 24 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/owMeD]\nWesley James Bergman, 37 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/rl2cm]\nElias Pendergrass, 44 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/wJ1XR]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/mOAqq]\nAnita Esquivel, 37 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/nMZFo]\nVanya Hummel, 24 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/DgwbY]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/wZqgM]\nJohn Davies, 55 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/VDg3M]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/twWHf]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/jjLfn]\nChristine Comello, 36 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/4mLJT] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/XxPPE] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/Vvnoz]\nAlexander Bradford Smith, 26 [http:<em>//</em>jailviewer.co.douglas.or.us/Home/BookingSearchDetail?BookingNumber=B20002631]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/0pex9] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/8Jli1]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/JkLAw]\nJesse Peterson, 30 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/gQg3e]\nJeffrey Accord, 36 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/j3yuB] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/UszGL] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/nJ9OU]\nFacebook stream mirror; [https:<em>//</em>www.bitchute.com/video/iCiNEzxzOaqd/ (embed)]\n2014 Ferguson Arrest; [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/IgEUL]\nInfo roundup; [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/JxZ4P]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/oTl3d]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/knQbj]\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/AEQgp]\nMilton Loice Moran, 48 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/PiJpR]\nAnthony Travis Bodda, 21 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/eQ8HB]\nAlexander Jones, 36\nUnknown [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/eAHK7]\nMichael Jarrod Bakkela, 41 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/DGEGz] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/Vr0Tj] [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/mqJnI]\nJonathan Maas, 44 [https:<em>//</em>archive.is/Hw9JK]\nCombat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

Your participation in the March for Life, and more recently your proclamation of the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month, are actions that confirm which side you wish to fight on. And I dare to believe that both of us are on the same side in this battle, albeit with different weapons.\n\nFor this reason, I believe that the attack to which you were subjected after your visit to the National Shrine of Saint John Paul II is part of the orchestrated media narrative which seeks not to fight racism and bring social order, but to aggravate dispositions; not to bring justice, but to legitimize violence and crime; not to serve the truth, but to favor one political faction. And it is disconcerting that there are Bishops – such as those whom I recently denounced – who, by their words, prove that they are aligned on the opposing side. They are subservient to the deep state, to globalism, to aligned thought, to the New World Order which they invoke ever more frequently in the name of a universal brotherhood which has nothing Christian about it, but which evokes the Masonic ideals of those who want to dominate the world by driving God out of the courts, out of schools, out of families, and perhaps even out of churches.\n\nThe American people are mature and have now understood how much the mainstream media does not want to spread the truth but seeks to silence and distort it, spreading the lie that is useful for the purposes of their masters. However, it is important that the good – who are the majority – wake up from their sluggishness and do not accept being deceived by a minority of dishonest people with unavowable purposes. It is necessary that the good, the children of light, come together and make their voices heard. What more effective way is there to do this, Mr. President, than by prayer, asking the Lord to protect you, the United States, and all of humanity from this enormous attack of the Enemy? Before the power of prayer, the deceptions of the children of darkness will collapse, their plots will be revealed, their betrayal will be shown, their frightening power will end in nothing, brought to light and exposed for what it is: an infernal deception.\n\nMr. President, my prayer is constantly turned to the beloved American nation, where I had the privilege and honor of being sent by Pope Benedict XVI as Apostolic Nuncio. In this dramatic and decisive hour for all of humanity, I am praying for you and also for all those who are at your side in the government of the United States. I trust that the American people are united with me and you in prayer to Almighty God.\n\nUnited against the Invisible Enemy of all humanity, I bless you and the First Lady, the beloved American nation, and all men and women of good will.\n\n+ Carlo Maria Viganò\nTitular Archbishop of Ulpiana\nFormer Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America\n","threadId":"9791246","timestamp":1593469930,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"8e51b7"},{"email":null,"id":"9791774","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9791246.html#9791774","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"[1]\n\nJune 7, 2020\nHoly Trinity Sunday\nMr. President,\n\nIn recent months we have been witnessing the formation of two opposing sides that I would call Biblical: the children of light and the children of darkness. The children of light constitute the most conspicuous part of humanity, while the children of darkness represent an absolute minority. And yet the former are the object of a sort of discrimination which places them in a situation of moral inferiority with respect to their adversaries, who often hold strategic positions in government, in politics, in the economy and in the media. In an apparently inexplicable way, the good are held hostage by the wicked and by those who help them either out of self-interest or fearfulness.\n\nThese two sides, which have a Biblical nature, follow the clear separation between the offspring of the Woman and the offspring of the Serpent. On the one hand, there are those who, although they have a thousand defects and weaknesses, are motivated by the desire to do good, to be honest, to raise a family, to engage in work, to give prosperity to their homeland, to help the needy, and, in obedience to the Law of God, to merit the Kingdom of Heaven. On the other hand, there are those who serve themselves, who do not hold any moral principles, who want to demolish the family and the nation, exploit workers to make themselves unduly wealthy, foment internal divisions and wars, and accumulate power and money: for them the fallacious illusion of temporal well-being will one day – if they do not repent – yield to the terrible fate that awaits them, far from God, in eternal damnation.\n\nWe will also discover that the riots in these days were provoked by those who, seeing that the virus is inevitably fading and that the social alarm of the pandemic is waning, necessarily have had to provoke civil disturbances, because they would be followed by repression which, although legitimate, could be condemned as an unjustified aggression against the population. The same thing is also happening in Europe, in perfect synchrony. It is quite clear that the use of street protests is instrumental to the purposes of those who would like to see someone elected in the upcoming presidential elections who embodies the goals of the deep state and who expresses those goals faithfully and with conviction. It will not be surprising if, in a few months, we learn once again that hidden behind these acts of vandalism and violence there are those who hope to profit from the dissolution of the social order so as to build a world without freedom: Solve et Coagula, as the Masonic adage teaches.\n\nAlthough it may seem disconcerting, the opposing alignments I have described are also found in religious circles. There are faithful Shepherds who care for the flock of Christ, but there are also mercenary infidels who seek to scatter the flock and hand the sheep over to be devoured by ravenous wolves. It is not surprising that these mercenaries are allies of the children of darkness and hate the children of light: just as there is a deep state, there is also a deep church that betrays its duties and forswears its proper commitments before God. Thus the Invisible Enemy, whom good rulers fight against in public affairs, is also fought against by good shepherds in the ecclesiastical sphere. It is a spiritual battle, which I spoke about in my recent Appeal which was published on May 8.In society, Mr. President, these two opposing realities co-exist as eternal enemies, just as God and Satan are eternal enemies. And it appears that the children of darkness – whom we may easily identify with the deep state which you wisely oppose and which is fiercely waging war against you in these days – have decided to show their cards, so to speak, by now revealing their plans. They seem to be so certain of already having everything under control that they have laid aside that circumspection that until now had at least partially concealed their true intentions. The investigations already under way will reveal the true responsibility of those who managed the COVID emergency not only in the area of health care but also in politics, the economy, and the media. We will probably find that in this colossal operation of social engineering there are people who have decided the fate of humanity, arrogating to themselves the right to act against the will of citizens and their representatives in the governments of nations.\n\n<u>_</u><u>_</u>\n","threadId":"9791246","timestamp":1593469892,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"8e51b7"},{"email":null,"id":"9791494","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9791246.html#9791494","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"THE NEWS IS FAKE.\nTHE INSURGENCY IS REAL.\nQ\n","threadId":"9791246","timestamp":1593468641,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"8e51b7"},{"email":null,"id":"9791468","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9791246.html#9791468","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"https:<em>//</em>twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1277661802395054080\nDoD whistleblower coming?\nSchiff investigation [hearing] coming? \nWIN BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.\nAll assets deployed.\nLIVE OR DIE.\n[D] PARTY [[F] PUPPET MASTER(S) (string pullers)] DEATH SPIRAL.\nQ\n","threadId":"9791246","timestamp":1593468482,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"8e51b7"},{"email":null,"id":"9790615","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9790475.html#9790615","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"https:<em>//</em>www.bbc.com/news/health-53218704?\nAnother Chinese special delivery?\nQ\n","threadId":"9790475","timestamp":1593464846,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"484318"},{"email":null,"id":"9790498","media":[{"url":"//media.jthnx5wyvjvzsxtu.onion/file_store/da4777a29c44624092b181d23e4d0c8572232ceb8c69b7f80dc2cc5adec47f6d.png","filename":"EVl0xrPXQAsAX3e.png"}],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9789693.html#9790498","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"When does COVID-19[2] MSDNC [fear] push end?\nThink 2020_P election +1.\n[D] party death spiral.\nQ\n","threadId":"9789693","timestamp":1593464295,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"867650"},{"email":null,"id":"9778955","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9778677.html#9778955","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"https:<em>//</em>twitter.com/TheSpunQ/status/1277331318389592065\nIf the news is untrustworthy, corrupt, controlled, and simply an extension [arm] of the [D] party…\nHow do you circumvent?

Armor of God\nFinally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\nAnd pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.\nHave faith in Humanity.\nHave faith in Yourself.\nHave faith in God.\nThe Great

warefare.\nInsurgency.\nInsurgency is the organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify or challenge political control of a region. As such, it is primarily a political struggle, in which both sides use armed force to create space for their political, economic and influence activities to be effective. Insurgency is not always conducted by a single group with a centralized, military-style command structure, but may involve a complex matrix of different actors with various aims, loosely connected in dynamic and non-hierarchical networks. To be successful, insurgencies require charismatic leadership, supporters, recruits, supplies, safe havens and funding (often from illicit activities). They only need the active support of a few enabling individuals, but the passive acquiescence of a large proportion of the contested population will give a higher probability of success. This is best achieved when the political cause of the insurgency has strong appeal, manipulating religious, tribal or local identity to exploit common societal grievances or needs. Insurgents seek to gain control of populations through a combination of persuasion, subversion and coercion while using guerrilla tactics to offset the strengths of government security forces. Their intent is usually to protract the struggle, exhaust the government and win sufficient popular support to force capitulation or political accommodation. Consequently, insurgencies evolve through a series of stages, though the progression and outcome will be different in almost every case.\nLocation(s) [cities] loss-of-control?\n[D] controlled?\nDefine 'stand down' [safe haven] order.\nDefine 'organized' group.\nCoordination of 'organized' [&amp; funded] group(s) in [D] controlled 'safe haven' cities across US [pre_knowledge to group(s)]?\nhttps:<em>//</em>banks.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1548\nhttps:<em>//</em>fitzpatrick.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/fitzpatrick-condemns-antifa-and-political-violence\nhttps:<em>//</em>thehill.com/homenews/senate/454038-2-republican-senators-introduce-resolution-to-label-antifa-as-domestic\nThank you for playing.\nHave a Nice Day.\nQ\n","threadId":"9377514","timestamp":1590854748,"trip":"!!Hs1Jq13jV6","userId":"c06c87"}]},{"email":null,"id":"9378157","media":[{"url":"//media.jthnx5wyvjvzsxtu.onion/file_store/cac3685006358dd9f87a2fe2013f4e4cffbff00f88d37be2949d11f3f267e20b.jpg","filename":"16577718_7293223_image_a_56_1564261558047.jpg"}],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/9377514.html#9378157","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"https:<em>//</em>2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/119629.pdf\nIrregular warefare.\nInsurgency.\nInsurgency is the organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify or challenge political control of a region.

The strains created by globalization, by the collapse of weak state structures, by demographic, environmental, and economic pressures, by the ease of cooperation among insurgent groups and criminals, and by the appearance of destructive radical ideologies, all augur a period in which free and moderate governance is at risk. \n[Insurgency is the organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify or chal- lenge political control of a region. As such, it is primarily a political struggle, in which both sides use armed force to create space for their political, economic and influence activities to be effective. Insurgency is not always conducted by a single group with a centralized, military-style command structure, but may involve a complex matrix of different actors with various aims, loosely connected in dynamic and non-hierarchical networks. To be successful, insurgencies require charismatic leadership, supporters, recruits, supplies, safe havens and funding (often from illicit activities). They only need the active support of a few enabling individuals, but the passive acquiescence of a large proportion of the contested population will give a higher probability of success. This is best achieved when the political cause of the insurgency has strong appeal, manipulating religious, tribal or local identity to exploit common societal grievances or needs. Insurgents seek to gain control of populations through a combination of persuasion, subversion and coercion while using guerrilla tactics to offset the strengths of government security forces. Their intent is usually to protract the struggle, exhaust the government and win sufficient popular support to force capitulation or political accommodation.

The metadata established several facts in this regard with granular precision: On the evening of July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC’s server. The operation took 87 seconds. This yields a transfer rate of 22.7 megabytes per second.\n\nThese statistics are matters of record and essential to disproving the hack theory. No Internet service provider, such as a hacker would have had to use in mid-2016, was capable of downloading data at this speed. Compounding this contradiction, Guccifer claimed to have run his hack from Romania, which, for numerous reasons technically called delivery overheads, would slow down the speed of a hack even further from maximum achievable speeds.\n\nhttps:<em>//</em>www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/\n","threadId":"7643557","timestamp":1577557723,"trip":null,"userId":"b8b53b","references":[{"email":null,"id":"7643842","media":[],"link":"https://8kun.top/qresearch/res/7643557.html#7643842","name":"Q","source":"8kun_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"DNC server(s).\nCrowdstrike.\nDid Russia 'break-in' to DNC server(s)?\nWhy did FBI accept 'indirect' evidence re: DNC server(s) 'hack''break-in' by Crowdstrike [Ukraine]? \nWhy didn't FBI 'directly' investigate DNC server(s) [in-hand]?\nDownload speed internal data DL vs remote?

The statements come as Beijing and Washington are headed into another round of trade negotiations in Shanghai.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump warned if China waits and he wins re-election, the trade deal will be much tougher for Beijing.\n\n“China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 – was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now – no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China, they just don’t come through,” Trump wrote.\n\nMy team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe. Then they could make a GREAT deal, like in past 30 years, and continue to ripoff the USA, even bigger and better than ever before.”\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday in Shanghai with a delegation led by China’s Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nAccording to Trump, “The problem with them waiting, however, is that if &amp; when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now… or no deal at all.

you have been selected as ‘threats’ and falsely labeled as ‘Foreign Disinfo’ agents (though they attempt to disguise at the bottom as 'not all'). This is an attempt to target &amp; remove by false pretense all threatening voices (ELIMINATION OF FREE SPEECH TO PREVENT LOSS OF CONTROL). These actions are now being monitored and would strongly encourage forwarding this information to the appropriate members of Congress, Senate and the media. We believe this is a ‘test run’ to effectively silence the opposition while testing the potential media backlash and/or 'official' response. This attempt to remove/silence (‘FASCISM’) those who oppose their view/narrative should further demonstrate their resolve to control the ‘message’ / ‘narrative’ (win at any cost).\nQ\n","threadId":"5335999","timestamp":1550885196,"trip":"!!mG7VJxZNCI","userId":"6a1c9f","references":[{"email":null,"id":"5336136","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/5335999.html#5336136","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"[Public

Civil Rights.\nHighlights:\n>Called for the sex-integration of prisons and reformatories so that conditions of imprisonment, security and housing could be equal. She explained, “If the grand design of such institutions is to prepare inmates for return to the community as persons equipped to benefit from and contribute to civil society, then perpetuation of single-sex institutions should be rejected.” (Page 101)\n>Called for the sex-integration of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts because they “perpetuate stereotyped sex roles.” (Page 145)\n>Insisted on sex-integrating “college fraternity and sorority chapters” and replacing them with “college social societies.” (Page 169)\n>Cast constitutional doubt on the legality of “Mother’s Day and Father’s Day as separate holidays.” (Page 146)\n>Called for reducing the age of consent for sexual acts to people who are “less than 12 years old.” (Page 102)\n>Asserted that laws against “bigamists, persons cohabiting with more than one woman, and women cohabiting with a bigamist” are unconstitutional. (Page 195)\n>Objected to laws against prostitution because “prostitution, as a consensual act between adults, is arguably within the zone of privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions.” (Page 97)\n>Ginsburg wrote that the Mann Act (which punishes those who engage in interstate sex traffic of women and girls) is “offensive.” Such acts should be considered “within the zone of privacy.” (Page 98)\n>Demanded that we “firmly reject draft or combat exemption for women,” stating “women must be subject to the draft if men are.” But, she added, “the need for affirmative action and for transition measures is particularly strong in the uniformed services.” (Page 218)\n>An indefatigable censor, Ginsburg listed hundreds of “sexist” words that must be eliminated from all statutes. Among words she found offensive were: man, woman, manmade, mankind, husband, wife, mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter, serviceman, longshoreman, postmaster, watchman, seamanship, and “to man” (a vessel). (Pages 15-16)\n>Wanted he, she, him, her, his, and hers to be dropped down the memory hole.

She explained, “If the grand design of such institutions is to prepare inmates for return to the community as persons equipped to benefit from and contribute to civil society, then perpetuation of single-sex institutions should be rejected.” (Page 101)\n>Called for the sex-integration of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts because they “perpetuate stereotyped sex roles.” (Page 145)\n>Insisted on sex-integrating “college fraternity and sorority chapters” and replacing them with “college social societies.” (Page 169)\n>Cast constitutional doubt on the legality of “Mother’s Day and Father’s Day as separate holidays.” (Page 146)\n>Called for reducing the age of consent for sexual acts to people who are “less than 12 years old.” (Page 102)\n>Asserted that laws against “bigamists, persons cohabiting with more than one woman, and women cohabiting with a bigamist” are unconstitutional. (Page 195)\n>Objected to laws against prostitution because “prostitution, as a consensual act between adults, is arguably within the zone of privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions.” (Page 97)\n>Ginsburg wrote that the Mann Act (which punishes those who engage in interstate sex traffic of women and girls) is “offensive.” Such acts should be considered “within the zone of privacy.” (Page 98)\n>Demanded that we “firmly reject draft or combat exemption for women,” stating “women must be subject to the draft if men are.” But, she added, “the need for affirmative action and for transition measures is particularly strong in the uniformed services.” (Page 218)\n>An indefatigable censor, Ginsburg listed hundreds of “sexist” words that must be eliminated from all statutes. Among words she found offensive were: man, woman, manmade, mankind, husband, wife, mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter, serviceman, longshoreman, postmaster, watchman, seamanship, and “to man” (a vessel). (Pages 15-16)\n>Wanted he, she, him, her, his, and hers to be dropped down the memory hole.

class=\"heading\">\"New Clinton Foundation Whistleblower  TBA Next Monday?\"</span>\n\n\nIn a discussion between Hannity, John Soloman and Sara Carter, something new came to light about the Clinton Foundation investigation.\n\nHANNITY: Now: there’s something percolating that will probably break Monday. You’re both smiling. Do either one of you want to give the audience….well, a little heads up…..\n\nJOHN: I’ll give you some breaking news right now, Sean. Just two hours ago, federal prosecutors  assigned to John Huber, the [Utah] US Attorney investigating the Clintons, reached out to a whistleblower in the Clinton Foundation, [this is the] first time we’ve seen contact between a Clinton Foundation whistleblower and that particular federal office. That just happened tonight.\n\nHANNITY: Are you talking about the one who’s home was raided?\n\nJOHN S.:No, this is a new—a different whistleblower that you might…..you’ll learn a lot on Monday, I betcha.\n\nHANNITY: All right, we’ll learn a lot more on Monday. Sara, last word…\n\nSARA: We need to keep our eyes—\n\nHANNITY: What’s the preview of Monday’s coming attraction?\n\nSARA (big laugh):  I think we’ve got a lot to look forward to on Monday, Sean. And I think the American people are going to see that there was [something]  happening behind the scenes at the FBS as well as the Dept of Justice.

Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\"\n– Ephesians 6:10-18\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. –That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\"\n– Declaration of Independence  \nWe Will Do Our Job to Protect the Vote.\nWill You Do Yours?\nWill You Answer the Call?\nWWG1WGA!!!\nQ\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1541354605,"trip":"!!mG7VJxZNCI","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"391","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#391","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"https://twitter.com/Mountainminder/status/1059134494127595525\nEyes on, VIP Patriot!\nQ\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1541352742,"trip":"!!mG7VJxZNCI","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"390","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#390","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/entertainment/museums/art-can-help-distinguish-between-conspiracy-and-reality-and-this-exhibition-proves-it/2018/11/03/e548a8f0-ded3-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html\nWhen you can't discredit this movement using logic and facts, you resort to comparing it to ART?\nHow many articles has the WASH POST released attacking the 'Q' movement? \nWhy is the WASH POST dedicated to attacking this movement?\nWASH POST owned by AMAZON?\nABC's &amp; AMAZON\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-details-about-the-cias-deal-with-amazon/374632/\nIf we aren't a threat, or real, or simply just a conspiracy theory, why the [constant] heavy attacks?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGkcTWCaio\n[Information Warfare][IW]\n[Destroy the Controlled Narrative]\nPOWER BELONGS WITH THE PEOPLE.\nWWG1WGA!!!\n<span class=\"detected\">(((Q+)))</span>\nQ\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1541351895,"trip":"!!mG7VJxZNCI","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"389","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#389","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"https://twitter.com/ABOwarrior/status/1058817590561292288\nEyes on, VIP Patriot!\nQ\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1541278316,"trip":"!!mG7VJxZNCI","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"388","media":[{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/5c15e42b4bed2355fe8917d50ddb778d6d8a002d1d4590b1e7918ceef3e97531.jpg","filename":"DbjsnHhU8AAXGpx.jpg"}],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#388","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"Who are the real racists?\n[2016 Democrat Nominee for President of the United States]\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-jokes-they-all-look-alike-after-interviewer-mixes-up-cory-booker-and-eric-holder\n\"THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE\"\nFake News Cover Up &gt; Prevent Black Americans from Seeing the TRUTH\nAnother FREE PASS?\nIgnorance is BLISS.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryweuBVJMEA\n[YOU ARE BEING CONTROLLED AND FED A FALSE NARRATIVE]\n#TakeBackControl\n#FactsMatter\n#SheepNoMore\nQ\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1541273902,"trip":"!!mG7VJxZNCI","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"387","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#387","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"[D] Party Con:\nWhen you can't raise money 'organically' through party (individual) donations (voter base) YOU STEAL IT from the American taxpayer and give it back to yourself in the form of campaign contributions. \n[Example 1]\nPlanned Parenthood\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-204R\n$1.5 billion provided in taxpayer funding over 3-year period.\n[Case 1]\nPP spent $30 million [disclosed - real estimates close to $65 million] in taxpayer subsidies to influence the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections.\n[Conclusion]\nShould it be legal for a taxpayer [D+R+I] funded organization to donate massive amounts of money to the D party in an effort to sway an election?\nD_insider_term: T_WASH\nRe_read drops re: Soros &amp; taxpayer funding\nYOUR HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS AT WORK.\nVOTE!

jurisdiction across all 50 states, is not a ‘special counsel’ so therefore nothing is being done \nBut… POTUS is attacking SESSIONS via TWITTER so therefore he is not working on behalf of the people’s interest (or POTUS’) [D’s/LEFT LOVE/TRUST SESSIONS!]\nBut… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are so many FBI &amp; DOJ senior officials being FIRED and/or REMOVED from their respective positions of power? Who is AG? Who must sign off on each removal? DOJ in charge of FBI?\nBut… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are there 50,000+ sealed indictments across the US [what % = USA v. X?]? Coincidence vs. HUBER start?\nBut… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are many ‘powerful’ CEOs, members of Congress/ Senate, resigning? Coincidence? Example: Pre_POTUS did the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE indicate wanting to leave politics? \nBut… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are human trafficking arrests SURGING?\n………………….\nClickbait &amp;

During this time, we also honor the brave men and women who selflessly respond to crises and disasters, rendering aid to those in need.  These first responders, who work tirelessly to safeguard our Nation and protect our citizens, deserve our utmost gratitude and appreciation.\n\nOver the past year, communities nationwide and across the Territories have witnessed and endured damage from multiple hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods, volcanic eruptions, and other natural disasters.  The historic hurricane season of 2017 included three catastrophic storms that made landfall within a month, and was followed by a destructive series of wildfires in California.  Combined, these natural disasters affected 47 million people and tens of thousands were mobilized to provide aid, comfort, and assistance.  We are also especially mindful of those currently affected by ongoing wildfires in California, Oregon, and Colorado.  In spite of tremendous challenges, the resilience of the American people continues to prevail.\n\nTragedies are somber reminders that preparedness is a shared responsibility and that it is critical to maintain readiness.  All Americans can prepare for potential disasters by developing and practicing a family emergency response plan, assembling a disaster supply kit, signing up for alerts on mobile devices, setting aside emergency savings, and maintaining adequate insurance policies for their homes and businesses.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Ready Campaign outlines other important steps to best prepare for a major disaster.\n\nThis month, I encourage all Americans to take the opportunity to ensure they have an emergency response plan in place and ready to be properly executed.  Emergencies and disasters test the resilience and strength of families, communities, and our Nation.  It is impossible to avoid every challenge and threat, but we can and must prepare for them.  By doing so, we can help protect our communities and save lives.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2018 as National Preparedness Month.  I encourage all Americans, including Federal, State, and local officials, to take action to be prepared for disaster or emergency by making and practicing their emergency response plans.  Each step we take to become better prepared makes a real difference in how our families and communities will respond and persevere when faced with the unexpected.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.\n\nDONALD J.

now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\"\n– Corinthians 13:4-13\n\n\"Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.

Religiously followed by a growing mass of disciples and vehemently assaulted by a variety of left wing propagandists ranging from Vice to Newsweek, the validity of its claims have sparked a uniquely passionate debate on both sides.  The ones championing its teaching as unquestionable truth range from imageboard dwelling millennials to a considerable number of boomers.  Be it truly the broadcast of insider intel or merely the flagship conspiracy of our time, it’s certainly an exciting read that provides quality entertainment for the end times.\n\nBut those faithfully trusting in Q to lead the overthrow of the evil “deep state cabal” and restore American democracy to the people may be missing a much darker purpose for the Qanon posts.  Used as a highly efficient propaganda tool, Q’s drops may actually be aiding an attempt to dismantle the judiciary altogether.  Should it succeed in pushing this distrust across the public through the oft-cited “Great Awakening, this narrative may actually serve to weaponize Americans into removing the only barrier left to toppling democracy and clearing the way for an Emperor to ascend to the throne. That is, of course, assuming that a coup d’etat has not already taken place.\nThe basic theme to the Qanon 8chan posts are that Trump and Sessions are frantically working behind the scenes to bring down what we all now know to be a very real and very corrupt deep state shadow government.  The antagonists — corrupt intelligence agency officials, congressmen, and news media plants — did not expect Trump to win and therefore are in “panic mode” over a number of crimes committed over the last eight to twenty years.  These crimes allegedly range from what we’ve seen already (election rigging, dark money, bribes take by elected officials and intelligence agencies) to the far-fetched (mass sex trafficking and pedophilia among elected officials). Some predictions have failed (Hillary Clinton being arrested in October 2017) while others have been eerily prophetic (the pope’s bizarre suggestion of changing the Lord’s prayer).\n\nPerhaps the most compelling narrative is Q’s assertion that high level crime and corruption has been committed within Obama’s Department of Justice and heads of the intelligence agencies, going up to his Chief of Staff Loretta Lynch.  Q compares the systematic dismantling of these “bad actors” to defusing a bomb: the right wires must be cut to disable the mechanism without detonating the entire thing. In this case, the “explosion” of an inadvertent detonation would be the complete collapse of the entire Judicial Branch of America. Q warns that if such an event could occur, all court rulings throughout this period of time could be rendered null and void, and ultimately be challenged according to our current legal channels.\n\nBut what if this is the actual plan?\nRead more:\nhttp:<em>//</em>www.amerika.org/politics/qanon-the-path-to-dictatorship/\n","threadId":"1952036","timestamp":1530244874,"trip":null,"userId":"03d4d6"}]}]},{"email":null,"id":"1952499","media":[{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/f49edb7866625738ed178ce60547ca27b8559911a19d08885339cfff1e2f3264.jpeg","filename":"2C269D96-B092-41DA-811B-50ACA73638A8.jpeg"}],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1952036.html#1952499","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"What vote occurred today?\nFull weight of the House.\nWhy is this relevant?\nProvides supportable grounds for?\nDeadline?\nQ\n","threadId":"1952036","timestamp":1530245647,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"f240d5"},{"email":null,"id":"1952168","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1952036.html#1952168","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Coordinated effort to ramp pro violent attacks (4ch 8ch /pol/) (threads).\nMods controlled (4ch).\nStaged to frame pro POTUS supporters.\nPush violence (trap).\nShareblue.\nCoordinated RL attacks (link).\nCause &amp; Effect.\nMSM outcry to force action.\nIt’s already begun (small &gt; large).\nhttps:<em>//</em>www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-parts-of-internet-celebrate-capital-gazette-shooting_us_5b3547bae4b007aa2f7e7226\nAnticipated.\nGoal?\nReady David?\nQ\n","threadId":"1952036","timestamp":1530244496,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"f240d5"},{"email":null,"id":"1950715","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1950477.html#1950715","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Site under attack.\nInfo shared highly sensitive.\nQ\n>>1950617\n","threadId":"1950477","timestamp":1530238838,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"fee7bf","references":[{"email":null,"id":"1950617","media":[{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/8c61b8b8e3ae25fd414a525ed09cff3ef4c083d848b68a8d8c6adc3f36f0ac53.png","filename":"wut.png"}],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1950477.html#1950617","name":"Anonymous","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>1949745 lb\nwut\npic of last bread\nalso error 502 host error\nDDoS?\n","threadId":"1950477","timestamp":1530238565,"trip":null,"userId":"98f40c"}]},{"email":null,"id":"1950581","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1950477.html#1950581","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"SEC TEST\nQ\n","threadId":"1950477","timestamp":1530238458,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"fee7bf"},{"email":null,"id":"1950407","media":[{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/d368afaba1f3cb1a27148e83640ea6773967d612947073e8c31b6ef5a094135f.jpeg","filename":"F1C6F4AD-DF36-4404-A117-F4A04C679255.jpeg"}],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1949745.html#1950407","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>1950237\nThink Bourne.\nCovert OPs classified.\nCareer installed.\nThink Cell.\nPast drops go missing.\nQ\n","threadId":"1949745","timestamp":1530237817,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"309a1c","references":[{"email":null,"id":"1950237","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1949745.html#1950237","name":"Anonymous","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>1950200\nSO is Q telling us Haspel knows of the program, but doesn't know where it is located at?

The Straits Times also saw a heavy security presence comprising MBS personnel and police officers.\n\nMr Kim, who is North Korea's Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, may also visit other sights such as the Esplanade performing arts centre.\n\nThe mini-city tour will cap a rather quiet public schedule for Mr Kim on Monday, compared to his officials and Mr Trump.\n\nApart from a meeting with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana on Sunday evening, Mr Kim has not been seen stepping out of the St Regis hotel in Orchard Road where he and his delegation are being housed at.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Kim's officials were seen earlier on Monday meeting with Singapore and American officials - making courtesy calls or engaging in last-minute talks over the one-day summit.\n\nMr Trump met PM Lee and also members of the American community in Singapore.\n\nhttps://  www.straitstimes.com/singapore/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-visiting-several-singapore-attractions-on-monday-night\n","threadId":"1698677","timestamp":1528731487,"trip":null,"userId":"eb9692"}]},{"email":null,"id":"103","media":[{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/bca70b8c6244d6fe4a71638133b484b22895252520db950c859440beec7cd514.png","filename":"MBS_KIM1.png"},{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/6be8a0b97570a6a353b0b634c4ba9935fa72fabbeb32d1cccf9027db8758026f.png","filename":"MBS_KIM2.png"}],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#103","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"No. 72\nWhere was Kim tonight?\nHow was this known?\nYou are watching a 'plan' being set in motion.\nEnjoy the show.\nQ\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1528730778,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"1694930","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1694790.html#1694930","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"FF weather alert (WW).\nStay vigilant and maintain situational awareness.\nQ\n","threadId":"1694790","timestamp":1528691264,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"c78f8c"},{"email":null,"id":"1694863","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1694072.html#1694863","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>1694833\n","threadId":"1694072","timestamp":1528690979,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"205f78","references":[{"email":null,"id":"1694833","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1694072.html#1694833","name":"Anonymous","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>1694816\nNot necessarily from /ourguy/s…\n","threadId":"1694072","timestamp":1528690899,"trip":null,"userId":"2f086d","references":[{"email":null,"id":"1694816","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1694072.html#1694816","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Every single picture posted is ORIGINAL.\nPulled/Wiped or Taken.\nThink about what that means.\nQ\n","threadId":"1694072","timestamp":1528690857,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"205f78"}]}]},{"email":null,"id":"1694816","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1694072.html#1694816","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Every single picture posted is ORIGINAL.\nPulled/Wiped or Taken.\nThink about what that means.\nQ\n","threadId":"1694072","timestamp":1528690857,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"205f78"},{"email":null,"id":"1694734","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/1694072.html#1694734","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Track ALL suicides.\nExample 1:\nThink Spade.\nTrace to Children Foundation(s) (NY).\nTrace to Import/Export.\nTrace from China/MX to Long Beach.\nTrace sale/spin off of Co.\nTrace to CF.\nTrace to Port (Security Clearance Profile (L5)).\nWho granted?\nHussein/HRC.\nExpect A LOT more.\nQ\n","threadId":"1694072","timestamp":1528690585,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":"205f78"},{"email":null,"id":"102","media":[{"url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/cb08ee5eedcbd44c10162e95e95bdf07545c460a4d7e94f92e5d6665f0886ed7.png","filename":"Specx.png"}],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#102","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"\n","threadId":"62","timestamp":1528690178,"trip":"!CbboFOtcZs","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"101","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/patriotsfight/res/62.html#101","name":"Q","source":"8chan_patriotsfight","subject":null,"text":"#FLY[RR]FLY#\nFailure per WH instruction / agreement.\nDECLAS_Public[3]\nEO dated_official\nIG redactions [heavy+][remove]\nHussein [WH [call] [tarmac] BC/LL] #RR#\nJC.\n#2.\nLL.\nBP.\nPS.\nLP.\n……….\n302s\nTexts\nTarmac\nFBI\nDOJ \nOperative insertion(s).\nUK [SIS]\nDark to LIGHT.\nShall we play a game?\n———————————-\nYou have a choice.\nDo what is right.\nFBI agents willing to testify +24\nNext DOJ -

Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\"\n– Ephesians 6:10-18\n\n\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.

Feeling a bit like POTUS today. Had a coworker lie about his screw up and blame it on me. My heart goes out to President Trump. The attack made on me is minuscule in comparison to the attacks our president and now the Q team experiences on a daily basis. \nI wish I could give all of y’all a big hug and express to you how grateful I am for what y’all are doing for us and our country. I am so thankful we have a president now who calls out the media and KNOWS his people are smart enough to discern the truth for themselves. We are sick of the conjecture and half assed journalism!!

Now in a bizarre twist, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is getting implicated in the whole deal <strong>with new evidence proving that he’s been working with Hillary and Obama this entire time to sweep the scandal under the rug. </strong>\n\nEver since Trump got into office one year ago, he’s had no shortage of traitors constantly trying to sabotage his presidency. \n\nWhile many of us have wondered for quite some time just whose side <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> is on, <strong>this breaking report confirms what many of us suspected all along, that he’s merely another Hillary puppet</strong> who’s existing in D.C. just to do her bidding and is doing everything in his power to further the cause of the “Deep State.” \n\nFor days now, the FISA memo has been on everyone’s minds, where its release is predicted to have huge implications on the Democrats. \n\n<strong>But for reasons that defy all human logic, Sessions is fighting to keep the memo from being released, idiotically claiming that this could damage our national security, and wants only the FBI to have access to view it. </strong>\n\nGateway Pundit reports: \n\nThe Sessions Justice Department is calling on House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) to allow the FBI to review the “shocking,” FISA abuse memo to ensure its release will not harm national security. \n\nABC News reports: \n\nThe Justice Department is urging the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, whose staff has compiled a secret memorandum purporting to show “shocking” political bias within the FBI, to give the department a chance to see the memo and warning that first sharing information from the memo with reporters would be “unprecedented” and dangerous. \n\nFurthermore, the department said certain allegations of impropriety are completely unfounded. \n\n<em>We believe it would be extraordinarily reckless for the Committee to disclose such information publicly without giving the Department and the FBI the opportunity to review the memorandum and to advise the [committee] of the risk of harm to national security and to ongoing investigations that could come from the public release,” a top Justice Department official wrote in a letter today to Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California. “Indeed, we do not understand why the Committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the Intelligence Community.</em>\n\nDespite these swamp rats’ efforts to keep the contents of the FISA memo hidden from the American public, the FISA MEMO was released, despite the opposition by Sessions, Rosenstein, the FBI, Adam Shiff and other libtards. \n\nIt’s absolutely unreal how Sessions remains in Trump’s administration. This isn’t the first time he’s been caught safeguarding Hillary and Obama’s secrets. \n\nA scathing report shows that under Sessions, the Justice Department downplayed critical evidence that linked Obama and Hillary to the Uranium One Scandal. \n\n..continued….\n","threadId":"821673","timestamp":1522269101,"trip":null,"userId":"c9d068"}]}]}]}]},{"email":null,"id":"822135","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/821673.html#822135","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>822075\nWe are being attacked on all devices used to talk.\n/GA/ is terminated.\n/Locked/ - no further posts on /GA/ - /KILL/\nSource is abroad.\nNOT domestic.\nQ\n","threadId":"821673","timestamp":1522269029,"trip":"!xowAT4Z3VQ","userId":"24b2f2","references":[{"email":null,"id":"822075","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/821673.html#822075","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"/CM/ locked out of /GA/ \nSniffer detects traces of bypass override.\nLayers upon layers.\nNew approach to silence.\nNew Board will be created.\nTeam to secure.\nTime to complete 1-2.\nQ\n","threadId":"821673","timestamp":1522268754,"trip":"!xowAT4Z3VQ","userId":"24b2f2"}]},{"email":null,"id":"822075","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/821673.html#822075","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"/CM/ locked out of /GA/ \nSniffer detects traces of bypass override.\nLayers upon layers.\nNew approach to silence.\nNew Board will be created.\nTeam to secure.\nTime to complete 1-2.\nQ\n","threadId":"821673","timestamp":1522268754,"trip":"!xowAT4Z3VQ","userId":"24b2f2"},{"email":null,"id":"821975","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/821673.html#821975","name":"Q","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"http:// www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/28/doj-inspector-general-investigates-alleged-fisa-abuses-by-doj-fbi.html\nThink outside the box.\nTiming of release.\nPost Facebook NEWS.\nFacebook WW.\nGOOG WW.\nAMAZON WW.\nTWITTER WW.\nTracking active.\nListening active.\nData shared.\nData USED.\nUSED FOR WHAT?\nKickbacks BIG TIME&gt;\nPrivate/Public.\nBypass regulations/laws?\nIntelligence A's across the globe in partnership to spy on citizens?

No more algorithms screwing up how we communicate with others on Facebook. No more capturing my favorite soda to sell to a competitor who might want to make me buy something else.\n\nAlso, and really important to me, is the right to be forgotten.

Think of it in terms of privacy, too. No more selling personal information. No more dedicated IPs to track your every move. No more email apps that pre-select your possible replies, because no more email being mined. \n\nMail could be configured with the same privacy rights as US mail, for example.\n\nLast I'll post on this one.

Anons, I've been following these drops since day one, but this is the first I'm hearing of this \"Behold a Pale Horse\" book from 1991, by Bill Cooper. It actually describes clowns planning to use school shootings as a way to disarm the citizenry. \n\nThis looks legit to me, astonishing as the quotes are. What say you all? \n\nBehold a Pale Horse — Milton William (Bill) Cooper, 1991\nhttp://  a.co/0IZY9ra\n\n“Bill Cooper, former United States Naval Intelligence Briefing Team member, reveals information that remains hidden from the public eye. This information has been kept in topsecret government files since the 1940s. His audiences hear the truth unfold as he writes about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the war on drugs, the secret government, and UFOs. Bill is a lucid, rational, and powerful speaker whose intent is to inform and to empower his audience. Standing room only is normal. His presentation and information transcend partisan affiliations as he clearly addresses issues in a way that has a striking impact on listeners of all backgrounds and interests. He has spoken to many groups throughout the United States and has appeared regularly on many radio talk shows and on television. In 1988 Bill decided to \"talk\" due to events then taking place worldwide, events that he had seen plans for back in the early 1970s. Bill correctly predicted the lowering of the Iron Curtain, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the invasion of Panama. All Bill's predictions were on record well before the events occurred. Bill is not a psychic. His information comes from top secret documents that he read while with the Intelligence Briefing Team and from over seventeen years of research.”\n","threadId":"401969","timestamp":1518826747,"trip":null,"userId":"ee1bed"}],"source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>402088\nBIG!\nQ\n","threadId":"401969","timestamp":1518828799,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"732b35"},{"email":null,"id":"98","media":[{"filename":"Just_Waiting.png","url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/c1a98bb6fc1779c51b784311f891229785663f9b07163a478cc03f0267b32e0a.png"}],"link":"https://8ch.net//greatawakening/res/1.html#98","name":"Q","source":"8chan_greatawakening","subject":null,"text":"\n","threadId":"1","timestamp":1518823167,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":null},{"email":null,"id":"97","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//greatawakening/res/1.html#97","name":"Q","source":"8chan_greatawakening","subject":null,"text":"“There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,” Rosenstein said. “There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.”\n\nFuture proves past:\n\nIn an effort to preserve the integrity of all U.S. elections, as ordered by the President of the United States, after an extensive investigation in select counties (the ‘sampling’), the DHS has concluded that while Russian entities (as outlined within SC Mueller’s investigation were complicit in attempting to undermine the presidential election of 2016) had no direct impact or bearing on the outcome of the presidential election, nor were any U.S. person(s) knowingly part of such an attempt to sabotage as it relates to the Russian investigation, U.S. and other foreign entities (as further described within DHS[XXXX]), acting outside of Russian agents, did attempt on numerous occasions, and were successful, in interfering w/ the presidential election of 2016, senate elections of [x, y, z], [x] elections, whereby several million of illegal, non-resident ballots (the “irregularities”) were counted, while legal ballots were improperly tabulated and/or intentionally mishandled.

As someone who spent the past 27 years working with him at EFF, I can say that nothing could be further from the truth. Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter: \"I knew it’s also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls 'turn-key totalitarianism.'”\n\nBarlow’s lasting legacy is that he devoted his life to making the Internet into “a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth . . . a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, we will be talking and writing more about what a extraordinary role Barlow played for the Internet and the world. And as always, we will continue the work to fulfill his dream.\n\nSource: https://

bread)\n>Obviously the train slowed down so must have been warned…\n\nI think it was warned.\n\nHelicopter surveillance saw the truck and warned the engineer.\n\nI'm guessing truck was kitty korner between the crossbucks with the back end (dumpster lift hydraulics boom) facing the oncoming train.\n\nTrain hits boom, spins truck around and rips body off the cab, leaving the cab at the crossing. Train drags truck body down the tracks until the body rolls off down the embankment.\n\nQuestion is, if truck tried to run crossing, why didn't occupants flee cab when getting stuck, unless train hit the truck just as it was trying to run the crossing.?\n\nHave to figure, though, if aerial surveillance sees truck and warns engineer, the truck had to have been there for a while, so why didn't occupants flee?\n\nIf the truck was there as a plant, the only sense I can make of it is that the occupants were patsies, i.e., they were told they were only going to force the train to stop, on the idea of an antifa protest.\n\nI don't think surveillance would see a truck headed towards the crossing and tell the engineer to brake, assuming the truck would stop on the tracks. However, it could be that the access road was closed and any traffic was regarded as a danger.\n\nKey is how fast does an amtrak train usually go through there, and how fast was this one going. If this train was slower, then why?\n","threadId":"231311","timestamp":1517462635,"trip":null,"userId":"5648a9"}],"source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>231746\nDrone.\nRe_read crumbs.\nQ\n","threadId":"231311","timestamp":1517462869,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"e2ade3"},{"email":null,"id":"231651","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/231311.html#231651","name":"Q ","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"POTUS is safe.\nProtected by PATRIOTS.\nQ\n","threadId":"231311","timestamp":1517462329,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"e2ade3"},{"email":null,"id":"231625","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/231311.html#231625","name":"Q ","references":[{"email":null,"id":"231205","media":[{"filename":"Screenshot 2018-01-31 at 9….png","url":"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/1e8fb02eda17cfc90eedaa84c6d760ed6f8543db6ae45ea7a8ccc37ed21d3d11.png"}],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/230599.html#231205","name":"Anonymous","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"\n","threadId":"230599","timestamp":1517460580,"trip":null,"userId":"42eae9"}],"source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>231205\nCoincidence?\nUSMC on guard.\nQ\n","threadId":"231311","timestamp":1517462245,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"e2ade3"},{"email":null,"id":"231058","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/230599.html#231058","name":"Q ","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"Effective yesterday, while standing under the statue of FREEDOM, POTUS FREED those ‘good’ people who are currently being blackmailed, threatened and enslaved.\nThose who stood chanting “USA” were FREED.\nThe shot heard around the world.\nTG&gt;\nWE, THE PEOPLE.\nFREEDOM DAY.\nLIGHT.\nQ\n","threadId":"230599","timestamp":1517460156,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"c3f516"},{"email":null,"id":"230503","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#230503","name":"Q ","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":"FREEDOM DAY.\nFREEDOM_\nQ\n","threadId":"229811","timestamp":1517458094,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"6f3736"},{"email":null,"id":"230358","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#230358","name":"Q ","references":[{"email":null,"id":"230252","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#230252","name":"Anonymous","references":[{"email":null,"id":"229941","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#229941","name":"Q ","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>229794\nWhat happened @ hotel?\n[AS]\nWhat is [AS] attempting right now?\nFavor repaid.\nQ\n","threadId":"229811","timestamp":1517456384,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"6f3736"}],"source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>229941\nPedo ring human trafficking at hotel, Adam shiftys district, he knew, he’s trying to cut a deal cause he knows he’s grass.\n","threadId":"229811","timestamp":1517457326,"trip":null,"userId":"4c1b8d"}],"source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>230252\nThe intel just dropped is bigger than you can imagine.\nQ\n","threadId":"229811","timestamp":1517457651,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"6f3736"},{"email":null,"id":"230091","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#230091","name":"Q ","references":[{"email":null,"id":"230019","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#230019","name":"Anonymous","references":[{"email":null,"id":"229941","media":[],"link":"https://8ch.net//qresearch/res/229811.html#229941","name":"Q ","source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>229794\nWhat happened @ hotel?\n[AS]\nWhat is [AS] attempting right now?\nFavor repaid.\nQ\n","threadId":"229811","timestamp":1517456384,"trip":"!UW.yye1fxo","userId":"6f3736"}],"source":"8chan_qresearch","subject":null,"text":">>229941\nsome incident with Adam SHIT happened at a hotel and was covered up.
